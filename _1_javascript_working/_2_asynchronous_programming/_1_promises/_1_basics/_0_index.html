<!-- // a promise is an object that returns a value which you hope to receive in the future, but not now.
// A promise has three states:

// Pending: you don’t know if you will complete learning JavaScript by the next month.
// Fulfilled: you complete learning JavaScript by the next month.
// Rejected: you don’t learn JavaScript at all.

// A promise starts in the pending state which indicates that the promise hasn’t completed.
// It ends with either fulfilled (successful) or rejected (failed) state

// The Promise constructor accepts a function as an argument. This function is called the executor.
// The executor accepts two functions with the names, by convention, resolve() and reject().
// When you call the new Promise(executor), the executor is called automatically.
// Inside the executor, you manually call the resolve() function if the executor is completed successfully,
// and invoke the reject() function in case of an error occurs. -->
