// JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language.
// In other words, JavaScript can do only one thing at a single point in time.

// The JavaScript engine executes a script from the top of the file and works its way down.
// JavaScript creates the execution contexts and pushes and pops functions onto and off the call stack in the execution process.
// If a function takes a long time to execute, you cannot interact with the web browser during the functionâ€™s execution because the page hangs.
// A function that takes a long time to complete is called a blocking function. Technically, a blocking function blocks all the interactions of the webpage, such as mouse click.
// A blocking function can be a function that downloads a file from a remote server or calls an API from an external server
