<!-- 

    To schedule a callback when the promise is either resolved or rejected, 
    you call the methods of the Promise object: then(), catch(), and finally()

    then() method --
    then() method is used to schedule a callback to be executed when the promise is successfully resolved.
    The then() method takes two callback functions
    promiseObject.then(onFulfilled, onRejected);

    catch() method --
    If you want to schedule a callback to be executed when the promise is rejected,
    you can use the catch() method of the Promise object:
    Internally, the catch() method invokes the then(undefined, onRejected) method.

    finally() method --
    Sometimes, you want to execute the same piece of code whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected.
