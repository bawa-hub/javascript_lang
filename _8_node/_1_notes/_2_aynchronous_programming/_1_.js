/**
 * Asynchronous Javascript
 *
 * Javascript is a synchronous, blocking, single threaded language
 *
 * Synchronous:
 * If we have two functions which log messages to the console, code
 * executes top down, with only one line executing at any given time.
 *
 * Blocking:
 * No matter how long a previous process takes, the subsequent processes won't
 * kick off until the former is completed.
 *
 * Single-threaded:
 * A thread is simply a process that your javascript program can use to run a task
 * Each thread can only do one task at a time.
 * Javascript has just the one thread called the main thread for executing any code.
 *
 *
 *
 * Just  Javascript is not enough.
 * We need new pieces which are outside of javascript to help us write asynchronous code
 * For front-end, this is web browser come into play.For back-end, this is where nodejs comes into play
 *
 * Web browsers and nodejs define functions and APIs that allow us to register functions that should not be executed synchronously, and should instead be invoked asynchronously when some kind of event occurs.
 * eg: that could be the pessage of time (setTimeout or setInterval), the user's interaction with the mouse (addEventListener), data being read from a file system or the arrival of data over the network (callbacks, promises, async-await)
