/**
 *
 * A module is an encapsulated and reusable chunk of code that has its own context
 * In Nodejs, each file is treated as a separate module.
 *
 * Types of Modules:
 * 1. Local Modules: Modules that we create in our application
 * 2. Built-in Modules: Modules that Nodejs ships with out of the box
 * 3. Third party modules: Modules written by other developers that we can use in our app.
