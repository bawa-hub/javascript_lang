/**
 * Although both crypto.pbkdf2 and https.request are asynchronous, https.reqest method does not seem to use the thread pool.
 * https.request does not seem to be affected by the no of CPU cores either.
 *
 * Netwok I/O:
 * https.request is a network input/output operation and not a CPU bound operation.
 * It does not use the thread pool.
 * Libuv instead delegates the work to the OS kernel and whenever possible, it will poll the kernel and see if the request has completed.
