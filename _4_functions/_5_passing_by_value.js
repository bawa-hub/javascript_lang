// JavaScript pass by value or pass by reference

// In JavaScript, all function arguments are always passed by value.
// It means that JavaScript copies the values of the passing variables into arguments inside of the function.
// Any changes that you make to the arguments inside the function does not affect the passing variables outside of the function.
// In other words, the changes made to the arguments are not reflected outside of the function.
// If function arguments are passed by reference, the changes of variables that you pass into the function will be reflected outside the function. This is not possible in JavaScript.
